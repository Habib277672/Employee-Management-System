Employee Management System (EMS)
Overview

Employee Management System (EMS) is a web-based application built with React.js that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. The application supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and uses LocalStorage for client-side data persistence without requiring a backend server.
